# Shrugman Game

## DAY 1

On July 15, 2024, I implemented a JavaScript project called Shrugman, a hangman-style game with the unique twist of using the shrug emoji as lives. This project demonstrates proficiency in JavaScript and covers various essential programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, random selection, and validation.

## Features

### Word Selection
- **Random Word Selection**: The game selects a random word from a list of words based on the chosen topic.

### Letter Validation
- **Letter Validation**: The game validates guessed letters to check if they are part of the selected word.

### Win/Lose Conditions
- **Check Win**: The game checks if the player has guessed all the letters in the word.
- **Check Lose**: The game checks if the player has run out of lives (shrug emoji).

### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Start Game**: Initializes a new game with a selected topic and resets the game state.
- **Manage Lives**: Keeps track of the player's remaining lives and updates the game state accordingly.
